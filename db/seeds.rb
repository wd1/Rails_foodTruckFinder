Gorilla cheese doesn't add too much to that equation - if you want to spend even more they'll throw a few pieces of cold bacon into the mix, but overall it won't cure the nostalgia you've been feeling for grilled cheese.")
review7 = Review.create(title: "Nothing Special",  rating: 3, truck_id: truck4.id, user_id: frankie.id , content: "Gorilla Cheese was conveniently placed and it is located at a nice place to stop at, but at my experience it took a while to get my grilled cheese, and frankly it wasn't very good. The tater tots were hot and delicious, but the grilled cheese was not good at all. It was overpriced for a not so good sandwich.")
review8 = Review.create(title: "Food Was Cold",  rating: 1, truck_id: truck4.id, user_id: rochel.id, content: "The food was cold when we got it.  I think the issue may have been that they were handing out orders in order even if the person had a huge order.  It took almost 1 hour to get our food from the time we started ordering.  They should, in the future, make people with larger orders wait longer so that the people who only ordered one sandwich don't have to wait as long.  Also they had the guy serving the food also handing out the food which made the orders back up.  Thus, my tester tots were cold.  I ordered the chicken parm and it was cold and the marinara made the sandwich taste mushy.  Perhaps they should stick to just grilled cheeses so that the line moves faster.  Also, the portion of tater tots was not worth the extra cost.")

I duno why the star rating is so low, my sandwich was nothing short of stupendous! I got the today's melt with a drink & tots for $9, steal! Today's melt was: muenster, bacon (good quality bacon & they didn't skimp on it), jalapeÃ±os & chipotle sauce on white. Everything was excellent! My sandwich was melted perfectly, there were plenty of jalapeÃ±os, lots of juicy bacon, & not too much sauce to mask any flavor. The tots were also awesome. The gentleman cooks were all very kind & flashed me lots of smiles. I had a very short wait & I was off to enjoy this cheesy goodness!")
